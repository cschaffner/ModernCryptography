{\sffamily\noindent
We will work on the following exercises together during the work sessions on \worksession.

You are strongly encouraged to work together on the exercises, including the homework. You do not have to hand in solutions to these problem sets.}


\begin{exercise}[Modular roots]
Show that the 7th root of 47 modulo 143 is $[47^{103} \mod 143]$. Note that $143=11\cdot 13$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Computing seemingly huge numbers by hand]
Compute the final two (decimal) digits of $3^{1000}$ (by hand).

\textbf{Hint:} The answer is $[3^{1000} \mod 100]$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The multiplicative group $\mathbb{Z}^*_{11}$ is a cyclic group. Give all possible generators of this group.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Explain why the discrete-logarithm problem in the additive group $(\mathbb{Z}_N, +)$ generated by $<1>$ is easy to solve.
\end{exercise}
